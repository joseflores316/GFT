# springboot-test-gft
Springboot test for gft company

## Requirements
For building and running the application you need:

JDK 17
Maven 3

## Running the application locally

Clone the project and use Maven to build the server

```shell
$ mvn clean install
```

There are several ways to run a Spring Boot application on your local machine. One way is to execute the `main` method in the `de.codecentric.springbootsample.Application` class from your IDE.

Alternatively you can use the [Spring Boot Maven plugin](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/build-tool-plugins-maven-plugin.html) like so:


```shell
mvn spring-boot:run
```
